I am a first year PhD student working on non-truth-conditional discourse connectives. I completed my undergraduate studies at University College London (UCL) where I was introduced to various aspects of the study of language from clinical linguistics to philosophy of language. During that time I also spent a year at the University of Heidelberg where I studied computational linguistics. In my fourth and final year I worked with Kriszta Szendroi on an experimental investigation on focus and disjunction scope parameters in negative sentences. This research project, at the interface between syntax and pragmatics strongly influenced me to pursue a PhD in experimental pragmatics. After my bachelor I worked for the French Embassy in Berlin and for the Franco-German Office for Youth but I quickly started missing the academic environment. A year later I went back to UCL to complete an MSc in language sciences with a specialization in language development. For my dissertation, I had the chance to be co-supervised by Nausicaa Pouscoulous at UCL as well as by Ira Noveck, my current PhD supervisor, at the Laboratoire de Linguistique Formelle. For this project, I worked on the processing of the discourse connectives but and so, which nicely prepared me for my doctoral research.

I am a second year master's student in cognitive science at ENS-PSL. I received my BA in cognitive & linguistic sciences and mathematics from Wellesley College in 2020. I am interested in the intersection of numerical cognition with the semantics and pragmatics of numbers and quantifiers.
