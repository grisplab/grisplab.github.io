        I began my academic pursuits by studying experimental psychology, with a focus on human reasoning, which led in no particular order to my interests in development, neuroscience, communication and language. It makes sense now to find myself in the richly interdisciplinary Laboratoire de Linguistique Formelle, where we are surrounded by experts from a range of linguistics subdisciplines and who study a wide range of phenomena. Similarly, the GRISP – using mostly experimental methods – is pursuing a wide range of issues as well.  We are currently carrying out projects on <i>discourse connectives, modals, numerical meaning, scalar implicatures (of course), idioms, irony, and metaphor</i>.

         I am a PhD student researching "What Makes the Processing of Idioms Unique?". Before I was in Paris, I was awarded a master's degree in Linguistics at the <a target="blank" href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de"> University of Göttingen </a>. In Germany, I completed a project on "The Vagueness of Indeterminate Gradable Adjectives" under the supervision of <a target="blank" href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/clemens+steiner-mayr/569384.html">Clemens Steiner-Mayr</a>. During this project, I sought to test my theoretical inclinations and rapidly I developed a great interest in experimental pragmatics. I came to Paris under the <a target="blank" href="https://mobility.smarts-up.fr/"> SMARTS-UP </a> mobility scholarship as an M2 student and this is how I began to collaborate with Ira Noveck on the topic of idiom processing.

          I am a second year PhD student working on non-truth-conditional discourse connectives. I completed my undergraduate studies at University College London (UCL) where I was introduced to various aspects of the study of language from clinical linguistics to philosophy of language. During that time I also spent a year at the University of Heidelberg where I studied computational linguistics. In my fourth and final year I worked with Kriszta Szendroi on an experimental investigation on focus and disjunction scope parameters in negative sentences. This research project, at the interface between syntax and pragmatics strongly influenced me to pursue a PhD in experimental pragmatics. After my bachelor I worked for the French Embassy in Berlin and for the Franco-German Office for Youth but I quickly started missing the academic environment. A year later I went back to UCL to complete an MSc in language sciences with a specialization in language development. For my dissertation, I had the chance to be co-supervised by Nausicaa Pouscoulous at UCL as well as by Ira Noveck, my current PhD supervisor, at the Laboratoire de Linguistique Formelle. For this project, I worked on the processing of the discourse connectives but and so, which nicely prepared me for my doctoral research.

          I am a second year master’s student working on a project on Attentional Blink. At the moment, I am investigating the structural processing of natural language on early stages of visual cognition and the role of structural saliency on conscious and unconscious perception by employing behavioral and electrophysiological measures in reduced awareness. During my first year, I did an ontology-driven study of numerosity perception, I worked on identity and unity conditions of object-file and analogue-magitude representations.

Before that, I was a postdoc with Judith Degen at Stanford ALPS lab doing corpus experimental research on (non-)exhaustivity in wh-questions. I completed my PhD at Rutgers in 2020 on the pragmatics of (non-)exaustivity, supervised by Kristen Syrett.

Before that, I completed my PhD in 2021 at the <a target="blank" href="https://www.hu-berlin.de/de">Humboldt University</a> in Berlin, where I worked on non-nominal metaphor processing under the supervision of <a target="blank" href="https://amor.cms.hu-berlin.de/~knoeferp/">Pia Knoeferle</a>. I’m most interested in how comprehenders think about the attitudes, beliefs and intentions of their interlocutors to make sense of the utterances they encounter. Together with Ira, we have developed this line by looking at the comprehension of <i>irony</i> and <i>scalar implicatures</i>. With <a target="blank" href="http://www.filippodomaneschi.com/">Filippo Domaneschi</a> (<a target="blank" href="https://unige.it/en/">University of Genova</a>), we are pursuing this line to study the processing of negative expressive adjectives (such as 'damn' or 'fuck'). At the University of Oslo, we are taking a developmental perspective to investigate why children seem to be more pragmatic than adults when it comes to tolerating imprecise usages of adjectives such as ‘straight’ and ‘full’.
