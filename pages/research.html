<h2>Discourse Connectives</h2>

      We are currently studying the processing of discourse connectives such as <i>but, so, because</i> etc. using behavioural (reaction times, truth-value judgments) and eventually electrophysiological measures (EEG). Our goal is to see how the processing of these terms differs from that of logical operators like <i>and</i>. In the future we are also hoping to run developmental studies on that topic.

<h2>Idiom Processing</h2>

      From what we can tell, the phenomenon of the <i>idiom superiority effect</i> has largely driven the conversation around idiom processing. Although idioms (e.g., <i>kick the bucket, break the ice, lift her spirits</i>) do appear to be unique among figurative expressions in their ability to be processed faster than their literal controls, we believe that this may have led experimentalists astray. For this reason, our goal is define the unique characteristics that idioms tend to hold and to assess the effect this has on processing.
